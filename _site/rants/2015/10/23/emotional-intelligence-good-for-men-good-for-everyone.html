<article class="post-content">
  <p>“Emotional Intelligence” is a subject of great interest to me. The phrase was coined in 1996 when I was 10 years old. Once I could understand it’s main thrust, I began noticing that the prevailing attitude toward it was one of dominantly male-gendered ignorance. For a young man to develop intelligence and vocabulary around his and others’ emotions was not a common feature of 1980’s-1990’s American society. Quite the opposite: it was hellbent on making boys “manly”, and that included preventing them from being “girly” in any way. Most of the men and boys I encountered seemed to have little useful information on the subject of emotions, and were famously averse to even discussing them.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I met a small handful of men and women who helped me learn to appreciate my inner world and develop the vocabulary to describe and discuss it. I am grateful to them because I now see the numerous and substantial benefits it’s brought me. I’m saddened that “being in touch with your emotions” is still such a gendered value, because a lot of people, men in particular, are missing out on a powerful and accessible approach toward life and  relationships that could really improve their lot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What Trust Can Accomplish</li>
</ul>

<p>I hypothesize that when we investigate any of Homo Sapiens’  daring accomplishments we find at their core: a network of individuals, sharing information and working together through the power of shared meaning and trust.</p>

<p>Trust is a beautiful thing. It is the ultimate outcome of Emotional Intelligence, and perhaps the most powerful factor in determining the outcome of our endeavors. When there is trust among people, their efforts align. They work together, adjusting their behaviors according to a shared objective and strategy. Work is divided, protocols defined, processes optimized.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trust turns even a small group into a force to be reckoned with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, a lack of trust is marked by people working at counter-purposes. The flow of information declines, meaning and purpose diverge, all leading to inter-personal problems and possibly the undoing of previous accomplishments. The damage can happen quickly, and it can be extensive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developing Trust</li>
</ul>

<p>In a sense, developing Trust is simple. We exchange information and meaning with another person and when enough of it (plus goodwill) builds up, we cross a threshold: Trust arises, and communication takes on the character of ease and fidelity. We access more and deeper information as our pool of shared meaning increases.</p>

<p>While simple in theory, in practice it means making countless practical decisions about what to do, think and say, all of which require our Emotional Intelligence. When we live in a society that says men should not be in touch with their emotions or discuss their feelings, we are inviting danger to our doorstep. Where men do not learn to manage their emotions, we see soaring rates of domestic violence. Australia is a disturbing example: 1 in 4 women have experienced domestic violence at the hands of a male partner. Unsurprisingly, when it comes to social and emotional support, male-to-male networks have long been operating at below capacity. Until men decide that enough is enough and get serious about developing Emotional Intelligence as a daily objective, individuals and society will continue to suffer through all manner of horrifying problems.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, I find it astonishing that men aren’t doing more to develop their Emotional Intelligence. In the rapidly shifting cultural and technological landscape of the early Information Age, Communications skills are more important than ever. We’d be doing everyone a big favor by studying and leveling up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is Emotional Intelligence?</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ability to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Recognize, understand and manage our own emotions</li>
    <li>Recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Stated so plainly, it’s hard to see why Emotional Intelligence should be so gendered. Nothing about it seems inherently male or female in the slightest. After all, everyone has emotions and everyone has relationships. Why should men be ashamed of discussing that? It doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p>My own definition of Emotional Intelligence is simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thinking, speaking and acting with an empathetic heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We yoke our powerful Homo Sapiens brain to a view that says: life (ourselves included) is full of complex, biological animals with a of <em>great variety</em> of unpredictable ways, and yet we are all equals in having an emotional core of wanting love and respect. So we train our actions, words and thoughts to fall in line with this understanding, all the while confidently knowing that we’re increasing our chances of better life outcomes for ourselves and others.</p>

<p>When we look at Emotional Intelligence through a more philosophical lens, it’s one of the great miracles of life. It connects us to the social order of the Human species. It’s the interface of our combined cultural and technological powers. When practiced by the skilled, it is an art. When studied by the scientist, it is the root of a thousand fields. And when we touch it, it touches us back, showing us the way to personal meaning and fulfillment.</p>

<p>Nor is it an easy thing to develop, especially if we’re working from a deficit. Like most endeavors we will encounter false starts, missed opportunities, and fuck ups, basically. Sometimes the way will be totally obscured to us.</p>

<p>But whatever we personally encounter, we’ll ultimately be better served by discussing our emotions and relationships openly, with men and with women. Men must seek a common purpose in building positive relationships at work and at home, and the study and practice of Emotional Intelligence would be a great way to start.</p>
