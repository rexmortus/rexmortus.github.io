<article class="post-content">
  <p>To be perfectly honest, I’m not well read in general. While this serves as an occasional source of embarrassment for me in social situations, I’m not broadly hindered by having only seen <em>Schindler’s List</em> and not read it. Still, I have regret and deep, deep embarrassment over the “list of science fiction books I have not yet read”. So I’m definitely not an expert on the subject.</p>

<p>Still, I’m a lover of science fiction, and when it comes to speculation of the technological and cultural variety, there’s nothing I love more. Through that grid, I have to say, I’m finding 2015 to be an astonishing subject. To start, the Internet is in the hands of <em>3 billion people</em> and rising. As personal computers go, there’s more power in more hands than ever before. “The Cloud” provides (those with access) unprecedented levels of storage and communications infrastructure. Our personal devices are imprinted with our lives. They can be hacked. And so on and so on.</p>

<p>Even the things we’ve been living with for some time, boring things like email, are still unbelievably amazing when you think about them. Since personal computers became a thing, we’ve gradually upped the ante on what is possible. In my own lifetime, computers have gone from hobbyist fascination to dominant cultural force to probably the salvation of human-kind. Computers are enabling unbelievable advancements in so many areas that it’s hard to keep up.</p>

<p>All this leads me to ponder the human-computer relationship. It’s a subject that feels more relevant now than ever. I wonder if someone has speculated about the “human-computer hybrid” as an abstract species, with yet unseen powers. Looking at my laptop, tablet and mobile devices all strewn about me, I think of what life was like before them and what it’s like now. It’s clear that we’ve crossed some cultural threshold.</p>

<p>I hope that our technological efforts continue to be bold and daring because we’ve got big problems to solve. The world is at war, climate change is proceeding, and time is running out. Humans and their computers are a force to be reckoned with. It seems to me that we have the tools, but maybe our priorities are still a bit out of order.</p>
